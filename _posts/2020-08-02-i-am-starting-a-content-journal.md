title: I'm starting a content journal

Not much to say here. I wanna be a more conscious consumer. I have a passion for film & TV, Music and Literature. I am a terrible consumer of all three. I tend to form obsessive phases around one specific form of art and consume waaayyy too much of it. I then get fatigued and go back to short form content on TikTok and Youtube. I think consuming all three in moderation might be a much more fulfilling approach. This journal is an attempt to track and test that hypothesis.
