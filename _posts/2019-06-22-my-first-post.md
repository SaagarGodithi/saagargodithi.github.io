# Wow! 

Welcome to my first post! *I don't have anything interesting to say* yet so here is a post about some really basic `Python` examples because it is the only `Markdown` file I have ever written and I really want to test a post. 

***

## Python basics that I still don't remember

- **range**

  - ```python
    range(6) # 0 to 5
    range(1,3) # 1 to 2
    ```

- **dictionary**

  - ```python
    # multiple key dictionary
    mydict = {}
    mydict[(key1, key2)] = value 
    
    # check if key in dictionary
    if key in dict:
      break
    ```

- **array**

  - *append*

    - ```python
      fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
      fruits.append("orange") 
      # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
      ```

  - *prepending*

    - ```python
      a = 1
      b = [2,3]
      [a] + b # [1,2,3]
      ```

  - *integer division*

    - ```python
      5 // 2 # 2 instead of 2.5
      ```

  - *subarrays*

    - ```python
      a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
      a[:2] # [0,1]
      a[3:] # [3,4,5,6]
      ```
