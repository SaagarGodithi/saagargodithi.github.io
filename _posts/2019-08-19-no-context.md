title: Day 1, no context
---

It is day 1 of my digital declutter process and I am more enthusiastic about changing my life than ever. I am ready to use this momentum to try implementing all the habits I've always wanted to but never could. Having a good morning routine is one such habit. Let me share what was going on in my mind as I started to think about a worthwile morning routine:

*I should begin my routine by writing down my goals for the day.*

*Wait, isn't there a system for that?*

*Oh, yeah! I think it's called Bullet Journal.*

*Let me look it up so I can do that.*

*Oh, wait. I can't.*

According to my contract, I cannot use technology for any non-essential task. I can no longer Google a tutorial on how to plan my day or watch Matt D'Avella on YouTube telling me about his findings after trying it out for 30 days. I am for the first time in an information vacuum â€” if you exclude books and talking to people. Do I actually have to come up with a plan by myself when there are thousands experts online who are ready to share advice for free? How do I know if my plan will be any good?

Another goal of mine is to try to listen to albums from a critical standpoint and maybe write some reflections or reviews. The first thing that I think I would want to do when reviewing an album is to go to metacritic and read some reviews by established critics so I can try to understand what lens to listen to the album through. Then I would go read the artist's wikipedia page and so I can gain context behind what inspired the album.  Then maybe go to Genius so I can read the lyrics and see some annotations on them too. But none of that is allowed. The only thing that I can use to judge the album is my mind. I have no training wheels to let me know if my opinion is any good. I have an irrational fear that **my opinion won't be right**.
