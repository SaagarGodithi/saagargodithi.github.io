title: My August 2020 TBC (To-Be-Consumed)
---

> Hi Goodreads users! I am borrowing TBR and appropriating it to TBC, the C stands for consumed. Thanks!

Here are the things I plan to consume in the month of August! I doubt I have enough time to do this but-

# Books
- **Hero of Ages (Book #3, Mistborn Era 1)** by *Brandon Sanderson*
    - **SPOILERS**: Finally on the last book in the Final Empire! I'm pretty excited for this one. *The Well of Ascension* (Book 2) really set up the stage for an exciting third act by leveling up the threat from fake god to actual god. And Brando Sando Lando is like known for his endings. So I'm very excited for the ending to the ending of the series. 
- **American Pastoral** by *Philip Roth*
    - This is the book that was selected for the book club I'm a part of. Way out of my comfort zone. Would not read this unless forced to. It's a literary fiction/historical fiction that is intentionally overwritten and has very verbose tangential train of thought writing style. It's good to expand literary horizons but I'm worried this might make me fall back into my high school reading habits, aka not reading. 
- **Pachinko** by *Min Jin Lee*
    - This was given to me by a friend more than 9 months ago at this point. I have seen a few interviews of Min Jin Lee and wow she is incredible. I have read the first few chapters and I'm loving the writing style - simple but deeply nuanced. I have a strong feeling this will make me cry. 
- **The Last Wish (Short story collection #1, The Witcher)** by *Andrzej Sapkowski*
    - I thought I might like *The Witcher* after discovering that it is allegedly one of the better character-based fantasy series. So I'm giving this a try. I think it's always good to have a short story book to read so there's a little bit of a breath to take between **thicc** novels.
- **The Way of Kings (Book #1, The Stormlight Archive)** by *Brandon Sanderson*
    - This is the book I have been building up to. I started my fantasy phase this year in May with the *Six of Crows Duology*. While I did enjoy it, I was craving something with a little less teenage angst. I ended up stumbing upon *The Stormlight Archive*, "The Greatest Fantasy story currently being told". After doing some research, it was suggested to me that I start with Mistborn instead before I dedicate myself to such a big series. As you can see, I'm almost done with Mistborn! Once I wrap up that (and the books previously mentioned), I will start this book - aiming to start by the last week of August. 

Keep in mind. I am obsessed with reading at the moment. It is the content that I have put the most thought into. The purpose of this journal is more so what follows. I have been reading too much then getting fatigued and then watching short-form content on TikTok and Youtube. Instead, I would like to read a little less and consume other mediums that I value equally as well. 

# TV Shows

- **Watchmen**
    - Damon Lindelof is the man who inspired me to start screenwriting. The first thought that came into my mind after finishing *The Leftovers* was "I want to tell stories like this". I immediately dropped 2 classes I was taking in the Spring and got into a UCLA screenwriting class. After the Emmy Nominations were announced, I was reminded of this show and disappointed that I haven't seen it yet. I will be watching this as both a fan and a student. 
- **Umbrella Academy Season 2**
    - It's out! I remember thoroughly enjoying season 1. Don't remember much of the actual show, however. Fun banter? Time Travel? End of the World? I'm down.
- **Death Note**
    - I am one of the sad few that saw the movie first. The concept of the movie was great, but the execution... I am looking forward to seeing the concept actually executed on properly. I watched the first episode and was surprised how quickly they set up the concept of the show. Also the animation is solid (at least on HBO). I was kinda worried the quality wouldn't be the best given it isn't the most recent anime. 
- **Love on the Spectrum**
    - Reality docuseries that a lot of people seem to be watching now. This was recommended to me. Not something I would watch normally. But I think it will be educational and cute. Plus, it will be a nice break from the more intense series mentioned above. 

# Movies

I read a book called *I'm Thinking of Ending Things* back in May. The audiobook is probably my favorite horror experience ever! Anyways, Charlie Kaufman is directing the Netflix adaption of the movie coming soon. So I thought I would watch a few of his movies because I fucking loved *Eternal Sunshine* so much. 

- **Being John Malkovich** 
    - I saw this a very long time ago. I remember 0. This is just such a goofy concept. I'm so excited. No words.
- **Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind**
    - I remember this being my favorite movie for a short period of time. I have rewatched the ending maybe 50 times give or take 25. Haven't really watch the rest of the movie again though. So I think it is about time I give it a rewatch
- **Anomalisa**
    - This is an animated movie that was brought to my attention by a friend. Supposed to do really cool stuff with POVs? I don't think I've ever seen an adult claymation.

# Albums
Went down to my apartment in LA and got my audio equipment. Have not taken advantage of it yet. Will mostly be listening to old favorites in the thoroughly missed high quality audio.

- **how i'm feeling now** by *Charli XCX*
    - Fun Fact: Charli used one of my lines on the song Anthem! She came up with the verses of that song over an IG livestream.
    - I want to listen to this with proper **BASS** and **deeeppppth**.
- **My Bloody Valentine Discography**
    - I am craving the carress of noise.
- **The Glow, Pt 2** by *The Microphones*
    - Listening in preparation for the new album!
- **The new Microphones album** 
    - lol
