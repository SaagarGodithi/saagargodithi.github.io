title: A reflection on 10 days with no technology*
---

*Read [Digital Declutter, A thirty-day break from Technology](https://saagargodithi.github.io/2019/08/18/digital-declutter/) first. I clarify what I mean by "no technology" there. 

------

This post is going to sound very negative because it's a reflection on how I can improve and I kinda need to address the negatives in order to talk about how to change them, but this week has been far from a bad experience. I want to preface this by saying that this week has by far been the happiest week of my summer. I've been reading a ton. I've been completely present in most of the interactions I've had and been able gain a lot more value from them. I'm producing meaningful thoughts — taking time to sit down, think and write. Listening to more music and podcasts consciously. I went to a party for the first time since spring quarter. I'm just doing a lot more than I have before. It's a good time. 

With that being said, this my reflection on the experience so far:

### Realization 0.5*: Things don't change in a day

The week at work started off very strong. I was super productive the first day. I was less distracted and got about 3x more work done than I usually do. However, since day 2, it's basically been back to normal (at least at work). I've achieved normalcy by new means — browsing through email and being super responsive on slack have been my new forms of procrastination. It's ironic how even though these seem like productive pursuits, I find them to be the most distracting things in the office. 

*0.5 because this was not really a realization but more of an educated guess based off of past experiences. This was expected because hopeful life altering cold turkey experiments are not anything new for me. This one is just unique because I actually seem to be following through on my promises for once. 

### Realization 1: We have *SO MUCH TIME!*

My screen time on my phone dropped from 5 hours a day to around 15 min a day. That's 4-5 hours of time I never had before. My day is only halfway done when I leave work. It's a surreal feeling. But then again, it's not that simple. Even though I gain so much time in my day, I don't find it any less difficult to let that time slip away from me. I elaborate on this below but tl;dr: being deliberate is hard.  

### Realization 2: The Freedom of choice is limiting

I really took advantage of my rules. It's very hard to consciously realize when you are engaging in self-destructive behavior. I spent a significant amount of time this week scrolling through movie listings on AMC, deciding what music to listen to on Spotify and browsing through books I never intended on buying on Amazon. 

If you have talked to me recently, you have probably heard me mention the jam study. Well, I'm gonna do it again because it is just so relevant to every part of my life. JAMMMSSS. I'm not sure who conducted this study but I read about it in *Modern Romance* by Aziz Ansari. Anyways, the people running this study had two tables out at a farmer's market: one table had just 4 jams to choose from and the second had 24 jams to choose from (or something like that I forget the exact numbers). Customers were free to stop by and sample the jams if they wanted before making a decision on whether or not to buy some. What they found was that even though people were more likely to try a jam at the table with 24 jams, people were TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY to buy one from the 4 jam table. 

My entire life is a table of 24 jams. I spend so much time tasting things that I rarely ever make a decision on what I want to do. When people say they've done nothing all day, they are lying. What they are really doing is tasting too many jams. 

We are prisoners of choice. We choose to not choose. *Real eyes Realize Real lies…*

### Realization 3: Searching for mental clarity doesn't work

While my rules in some cases were a little too liberal (#2), when it came to music, they were way too strict. I am only allowed to consume music if that is the sole thing I am doing at that time. I was romanticizing the idea of deliberacy too much. I now realize that I took it to an extreme that was not beneficial for me. 

Music is a complicated being. It is a vehicle to transport you to engaging worlds. It is a form of carefree relaxation. It's a way to numb you from external stiumuli so you can focus on yourself.

I thought that forcing myself to completely embrace the idea of Conscious Media Consumption would make me more likely to enjoy music. It instead did the opposite. Albums became intimidating. I detail one of these intimidating album listening experiences in [Day 2, The Mind is a Whore](https://saagargodithi.github.io/2019/08/20/mind-whore/). Essentially, because it was the only thing I was allowed to do, I felt compelled to make the most of the experience. I tried my hardest to abstract as much as I could from each song. Every time I listened to music, I felt like I was in a mental cage match with myself (not in a ooh exciting mental challenge kinda way, more like screaming the **LET ME IN!** part of the chorus from *Guest House* by Daughters). My main outlet for releasing stress became the very thing that caused it. Music became *stressful*.

[Here's a (slightly altered) quote by my favorite digital minimalist JPEGMAFIA:](https://open.spotify.com/track/5pUudDDuJgIpgKIGk2zmxv?si=Jcvf3TVjSeqfJk06mIlynA)

> *It's ironic how you **stress yourself out by seeking mental clarity***
>
> *And have the nerve **to say you are "trying to live deliberately"**, wow*
>
> *You ain't real, you're a Jarrod*

Damn, Peggy. 

*Hidden Brain* recently did an episode on Tunnel Vision. In the episode, my guy Shankar explores the science behind the Paradox of Scarcity. I learned that when we are deprived of a resource we tend to try so hard to get it back that we lose sight of the big picture, which can in turn compromise the original goal of attaining said resource. I was being a Jarrod. I was so desperate for attaining mental clarity that I forgot about all its necessary background components: good nutrition, regular exercise and plain old *nothingness*. Sometimes it is necessary to do *nothing* in order to ensure that the value of everything else you do isn't *nothing*. 

Doing nothing is OK. I was initially scared of this idea because it directly conflicts with the philosophy of living a deliberate life. Right? Then I realized that I can be deliberate about doing nothing too. Passive listening makes active listening worth it. Listening to an album passively can you give a better (subconscious) feel for it, which really helps when trying to analyze it critically. It also just puts you in the mood to be able to embrace an album with the dedication that active listening requires. It makes music fun again (MMFA).

### Realization 4: Being focused can actually be *LESS* exhausting 

This was a realization I made while concurrently reading the book *Deep Work* by Cal Newport. This point conflicts with the previous, so let me explain. Focus is costly. It does indeed require energy and you need to give yourself time to relax in order to replenish yourself. But switching focus is deadly. This is what I now identify as the exhaustion I talking about in my first post. I was exhausted because the plethora of information available on the internet incentived me to constantly switch my focus between things. And whatever mental tax associated with it compounded into something unsustainable.

I attempted to engage in deep work while at the office a couple of days ago. To me, this means working without switching focus to email or slack for an extended period of time. Sure, I was bored (#7). A lot. But what I found was that my energy levels for the rest of the day were actually much higher than usual. I felt more satisfied about the work I was doing and was just happier that day overall. I often get intimidated by work because I am scared of the mental exhaustion that I think I will endure by diving deep into it. It's funny to see now that it is the fear of work that causes exhaustion and not the work itself.  

**Note:** I have not been able to replicate my results since (#0.5). This requires some serious habit building. 

### Realization 5: Knowing less is knowing more

*Foreshadowing yet another paradox.* 

A small hesitation I had with this experiment was that I would be uninformed for a month. Stupid for a month. I explore this fear in [Day 1, no context](https://saagargodithi.github.io/2019/08/19/no-context/). Well, I don't feel this way anymore. Woah! How's that? No more information overload. 

With the internet we have immediate access to almost all the information in the world. It's very easy to get overwhelmed by this, especially when we always want to know more. We would rather get a tl;dr on something than take the time to dive into the material because there's probably something a lot more interesting only a click away. 

Not having access to unlimited tl;drs has led me to engage with fewer things with deeper focus. I feel like I'm able to abstract and retain more information than usual from the fewer resources at my disposal (basically just books). I feel smarter after this week. Even though I am consuming less, the information that I'm consuming is richer and has more time to mature in my head. I find myself being able to apply the information I consume a lot more constructively through engaging discussion and meaningful thoughts.

I am not convinced that the information found in books is any better than that from films/videos, but I do understand it's appeal a lot more now. When you read a book, in order to gain anything out of it you need to be focused because you are the one that creates all the internal imagery that reinforces the information presented. For video and even audio, that part is done for you. It provides the illusion of retention because you can still gain something out of the experience while being half focused. You can get a general idea of the story/structure. That is not the case with books. It's a little more 'all or nothing'. If you don't focus you don't get any return. Reading books forces you to retain information better than other mediums. 

Here is something slightly related that I would like to explore more later: in the internet age it is almost useless know things. I feel like one of the best skills you can have today is not knowing information but being resourceful and finding relevant information efficiently. Does it even matter to know anymore?

### Realization 6: Sleepiness != Lethargy 

These are two very different feelings that I've always confused as the same thing. Sleepiness is exactly what it sounds like, it's the feeling of how easy it is to fall asleep. I'm a whole lot more sleepy by the end of the day and tend to want to sleep earlier now. BUT I feel less lethargic. Put in other words, I feel less mentally exhausted. I have higher energy levels and feel a lot more present. I feel less tired but ironically can pass out with ease. Moral of the story is that blue light sucks. 

### Realization 7: Boredom is primarily born out of fear 

I get bored just as often as I did before. The only difference, however, is that 10 days ago as soon as that happened I was able to reach into my pocket and eliminate that boredom instantly. Now, I am forced to stare boredom in the face. I see that I am not bored because I have nothing to do but rather because I am scared to do the thing in my life that probably excites me the most. Satisfying things are hard. When you run out of easy things to do, it might seem like there is nothing left. But in reality, everything left to do is just *dauntingly satisfying*.

------

I feel like I probably encountered most of these ideas earlier in random blog posts or YouTube videos. They don't seem unique at all. But I only really feel like I've absorbed and understood them after this week. I guess it ties into #5 — if we stop trying to look at everything, we can start to abstract significant value from the things right in front of us. 

As Reviewbrah of *Report Of The Week* once said, "Everything Burger King touches turns to garbage". Reviewbrah is right. In this case, Burger King is your mind. But the thing is that if you use your mind correctly, it can retain worlds of information and create magical things. One of those magical things, ladies and gentlemen, is the **Popeyes Chicken Sandwich**. Burger King is the parent company of Popeyes. I was compelled to finish this metaphor. I am not apologizing for my sense of humor.

## updates to rules

Here are a list of changes I am making to my technology rules to reflect the lessons learned from the past week:

- Choice sucks 
  - Only allowed to check email between 11:15-11:30 AM and 8:30-8:45PM.
  - Only allowed to check slack between 11:15-11:30 AM, 12:45-1:00PM (after lunch break) and 4:15-4:30 PM.
  - Only allowed to use Amazon and AMC between 6:30-6:45 PM.
  - No FaceTime after 10 PM — I need sleep without blue light. 
  - Only allowed to listen to 4 Albums — Spotify consumption will now always be offline. The 4 albums are *Hidden In Your Wilderness* by Julia Holter, *The Idler Wheel…* by Fiona Apple, *Hounds of Love* by Kate Bush and *Veteran* by JPEGMAFIA. 
- Passive consumption is OK
  - Can listen to music anywhere.
  - I need lyrics — I spent an hour, a couple of days ago, entering all the lyrics for the 4 albums on a markdown file so they are available offline.
