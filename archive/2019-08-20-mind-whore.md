title: Day 2, The mind is a whore
---

Here's what I've learned today (or rather what I've always known but never cared about until now): the human mind wants to be constantly stimulated. I am naturally drawn towards multitasking because for some reason I feel incredibly vulnerable when committed to focusing on just one thing. It's daunting to build a monogamous relationship with the present moment. It's never cuffing season with the mind.

Last night, I sat down and listened to **Tidal** by *Fiona Apple*. It has been quite sometime since I've *tried* to do nothing but listen to an album in its entirety. While it was an incredible experience *trying* to be completely immersed in the music, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. 

It felt like watching a film in a theater where the only people in the room were you and your obnoxious friend munching on popcorn, slurping on their soda and taking all the room on the shared arm space. They can't help but make dumbass suggestions every couple of seconds like:

*Yo, pay attention to the lyrics!*

*Woah! Are you hearing this instrumentation? You should listen to the instrumentation.*

*Wait, what did she just say? I couldn't tell. Can you go back? Go back! I didn't hear what she said.*

I spent more mental energy thinking about how I should listen to the music than actually listening to the music itself. Being that mentally distracted really took away from the listening experience, but it made it *easier*. 

Today was more of the same. Enthusiasm is already fleeting and it's only day 2. I found myself replacing my usual mind numbing habits with new ones. Scrolling through Instagram during my bathroom break was replaced with scrolling through my Screen Time stats in the settings app. Messaging my friends on facebook was replaced by engaging with and reacting to unnecessary posts on my work's Slack.

I couldn't even sit still and read an Aziz Ansari book â€” no disrespect, Aziz. I was so desperate for external stimulation that I starting picking at my mouth and accidentally PULLED OUT A TOOTH.

Without Facebook or Instagram, will the rest of my 29 teeth be enough for the next 29 days?
