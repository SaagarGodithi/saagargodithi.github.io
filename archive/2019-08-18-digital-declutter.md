title: Digital Declutter, A thirty-day break from Technology
---

*Where did all my time go?*

*Why do I feel so mentally taxed all the time?*

These are questions that I find myself thinking about on a regular basis. With 3-5 hours of on-screen time per day just on my phone (plenty more on my laptop and iPad), it is evident that I am an information addict. The constant consumption of content through social media, instant messaging, blogs, news and streaming services has taken away all of my mental clarity. My relationship with technology has become exhausting and unsustainable. So what am I going to do about it?

## Digital Minimalism

I was recently inspired to make significant changes to my life after reading the book **Digital Minimalism** by *Cal Newport*. In the book, Newport makes an argument for digital minimalism as a way to live a *deliberate life* in the age of the internet. 

The philosophy of digital minimalism is as follows:
>A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else. 

According to the book, the first step to transitioning to a life as a digital minimalist is to take a thirty-day break from all optional technologies in your life. The rest of this post is me navigating what technologies are optional to me. I don't want to be too strict on myself because going cold turkey  has historically never worked for me. I want to be realistic and design a sustainable digital declutter contract. 

This is not permanent. Over the next thirty days, I hope to explore and rediscover the things in my life that I find value in. And evenutally, when this thirty-day break is done, I will try to reintegrate technologies that I find maximize said value. With that being said, these are my new *Technology Rules*. 

## The Technology Rules

### No Social Media 

This is kind of obvious. Social media is very optional for me, especially because I am alone in San Diego all summer. I will be deactivating my Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and TikTok (lol) accounts. The way these apps are engineered to take advantage of our human psychological shortcomings is evil and by far the thing that is most detrimental to my mental clarity currently. But still, it will be annoying to not know when an album drops or miss out on a tour announcement. 

### No Texting

On average, the vast majority of my on-screen time on my iPhone is made up of time on iMessage and Messenger. While this will make it incredibly inconvenient to communicate and coordinate with people, I think the feeling of no longer having the urge to immediately reply to a text will make this sacrifice worth it. I find phone calls and FaceTime a lot more meaningful when connecting with people. I hope that this inspires me to call people I care about more frequently and actually listen to their voices. However, I will miss shitposting on Messenger and covering people's messages with stickers on iMessage.

### No News/Blogs

While I do think it is incredibly important to stay updated on current affairs, unfortunately, current news media and blogs are designed to make you click and click forever. I have learned to be okay with the idea of being uninformed for a month to stay clear of getting constantly bombarded by clickbait articles. I'm gonna miss Pitchfork.

### No YouTube/Netflix/Prime Video etc. 

This is by far the hardest thing for me to give up. I think YouTube is one of the few platforms where the positives I gain from the content I consume still marginally outweight the negatives of mindlessly clicking on recommeded videos. I spend a huge chunk of my time consuming video content and I do not know yet what boredom curing activity will replace this during my thirty-day break.

**Exception**: Consuming restricted content such as YouTube or Netflix in an in-person social setting is OK. I'm not gonna forcefully close my eyes if my friends want to watch *The Great British Bake Off* with me.

### No Random Web/App Usage

Basically, all web and app usage is banned except the following.

#### Websites that are allowed

- Work starter pack: Email, Asana and Slack
- Amazon-type websites: Websites required to buy things like new books, concert and museum tickets, airplane and train tickets etc. 
- Educational and professional websites that are necessities for furthering personal projects and the software engineering internship recruiting process
  - This is the most vague categorization of websites on the whole list. I am worried I might fall into a clicking tunnel like usual. Hopefully the purge from all other content that promotes this type of behavior will help me be more aware of when this happens.
  - LinkedIn is banned. LinkedIn is the **worst**.  
- This blog lol 

#### Apps that are allowed

- Google Maps
- FaceTime
- Spotify*
- Podcasts*
- iBooks*
- AMC*
- Uber/Lyft
- Venmo/Zelle

### *Conscious Media Consumption

I cannot purge myself of all media because I personally find music and film to be a *mandatory* part of my life. A majority of my life outside of school/work is dedicated to appreciating the arts — whether that be through watching movies or listening to albums. But something that I do want to eliminate from my life is what I call *Background Media Consumption*. 

From now on I will try to eliminate any form of multitasking while watching content or listening to music. This means no playing music in the background while showering, eating, cooking, driving, working or exercising. Often times I find myself getting through an entire album while multitasking without really remembering much of it. Additionally, I find that I am less focused and spend far more time/mental energy than necessary on tasks that I do while listening to music. If I do listen to music, that will be the *only* thing I am doing at that time. I won't put a hard rule on this, but I hope that this approach to music consumption pushes me towards listening and analyzing music in album form, as opposed to individual songs. 

Since I have basically eliminated all ways of watching movies online, the only feasible way for me to watch movies is by going to the movie theater. This is fine by my rule because being in a theater requires you to be 100% focused on the movie you are watching. I am currently an AMC A List member so I can see upto 3 movies a week in theaters. Over the past summer, there has never been a week where I was compelled to use all 3 films because Summer Movies suck! But even if I do go 3 times a week, I won't feel that guilty because the 6 hours of time it would take from my week is nothing compared to the amount of time I usually lose to YouTube and Netflix on weekly basis. 

I am going to be the most lenient with my use of Podcasts/Audiobooks because I find that I can abstract value from them even while multitasking. The idea of being alone with my thoughts while commuting or exercising is far too daunting and not the main point of the thirty-day break (although it should be addressed later). I am giving myself unrestricted access to Podcasts and Audiobooks in all settings except while working. My only fear with this freedom is that I will spend an absurd amount of time battling analysis paralysis everytime I sit down to decide which podcast/audiobook I want to listen to that day. So to combat this I am going to be restricting the catalogue to only 3 sources: Hidden Brain by NPR (from latest episode to oldest), Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins and Born a Crime by Trevor Noah. 

## Trying to live a deliberate life

I have a lot of books on my reading list, a lot of Leetcode problems to grind through, a couple of personal projects I've been meaning to get started on, this blog and Kate Bush's & Fiona Apple's discographies to get through. So there's a lot for me to do with all this free time I'm forcing onto myself. I have three weeks left in San Diego — I can finally make time to go rock climbing and/or surfing. I hope my inevitable boredom will push me to do at least some of these things. But even if that does not end up happening, my only goal is that if someone asks me:

*What did you do today, Saagar?*

I won't say:

*I don't know… nothing.*

I want to live a satisfying life. And I think that being more present and making conscious decisions about how I spend my time is how I will achieve this goal.

So if you want to stay in contact, please <del>call,</del> (cannot disable text without disabling call) FaceTime/FaceTime Audio or email me! *Bye!*
