title: A reflection on 10 days with no technology*
---

*Read [Digital Declutter, A thirty-day break from Technology](https://saagargodithi.github.io/2019/08/18/digital-declutter/) first. I clarify what I mean by "no technology" there. 

------

This post is going to sound very negative because it's a reflection on how I can improve and I kinda need to address the negatives in order to talk about how to change them, but this week has been far from a bad experience. I want to preface this by saying that this week has by far been the happiest week of my summer. I've been reading a ton. I've been completely present in most of the interactions I've had and been able gain a lot more value from them. I'm producing meaningful thoughts — taking time to sit down, think and write. Listening to more music and podcasts consciously. I went to a party for the first time since spring quarter. I'm just doing a lot more than I have before. It's a good time. 

With that being said, this my reflection on the experience so far:

### Realization 0.5*: Things don't change in a day

The week at work started off very strong. I was super productive at work the first day. I was approximately 3x more productive than on a usual day. However, since day 2, it's basically been back to normal (at least at work). I've achieved normalcy by new means — browsing through mail and being super responsive on slack have been my new forms of procrastination. It's ironic how even though these seem like productive pursuits, I find them to be the most distracting things in the office. 

*0.5 because this was not really a realization but more of an educated guess based off of past experiences. This was expected because hopeful life altering cold turkey experiments are not anything new for me. This one is just unique because I actually seem to be following through on my promises for once. 

### Realization 1: We have *SO MUCH TIME!*

My screen time on my phone dropped from 5 hours a day to around 15 min a day. That's 4-5 hours of time I never had before. My day is only halfway done when I leave work. It's a surreal feeling. But then again, it's not that simple. Even though I gained so much time in my day, I don't find it any less difficult to let that time slip away from me. I elaborate on this below but tl;dr: being deliberate is hard.  

### Realization 2: The Freedom of choice is limiting

I really took advantage of my rules. It's very hard to consciously realize when you are engaging in self-destructive behavior. I spent a significant amount of time this week scrolling through movie listings on AMC, deciding what music to listen to on Spotify and browsing through books I didn't intend to buy on Amazon. 

If you have talked to me recently you have probably heard me mention the jam study. I'm gonna do it again because it is just so relevant to every part of my life. JAMMMSSS. I'm not sure who conducted this study but I read about it in *Modern Romance* by Aziz Ansari. Anyways, the people running this study had two tables out at a farmer's market: one table had just 4 jams to choose from and the second had 24 jams to choose from (or something like that I forget the exact numbers). Customers were free to stop by and try some samples if they wanted before making a decision on what to buy. What they found was that even though people were more likely to try a jam at the table with 24 jams, people were TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY to buy jam from the 4 jam table. 

VVVVVVVVVVVVVVV connect study to your life

We are prisoners of choice. We choose to not choose. *Real eyes Realize Real lies…*

### Realization 3: Searching for mental clarity doesn't work

While my rules in some cases were a little too liberal (#2), when it came to music they were way too strict. The only time I am allowed to consume music if that is the ONLY thing I am doing. I was romanticizing the idea of deliberacy so much. I now realize I took it to an extreme that is not beneficial for me. 

Music is a complicated being. It is a vehicle to transport you to engaging worlds. It is a form of carefree relaxation. It's a way to numb you from external stiumuli so you can focus on yourself.

I thought that forcing myself to completely embrace the idea of Conscious Media Consumption would make me more likely to enjoy music. It instead did the opposite. Albums became intimidating. I detail one of these intimidating album listening experiences in [Day 2, The Mind is a Whore](https://saagargodithi.github.io/2019/08/20/mind-whore/). Essentially, because it was the only thing I was allowed to do I felt compelled to make the most of the experience. I tried my hardest to abstract as much as I could from each song. Every time I listened to music felt like a mental cage match with myself (not in a ooh exciting mental challenge kinda way, more like screaming the **LET ME IN!** part of the chorus from *Guest House* by Daughters). My main outlet for releasing stress became the very thing that caused it. Music became *stressful*.

Here's a (slightly altered) quote by my favorite digital minimalist JPEGMAFIA:

> It's ironic how you **stress yourself out by seeking mental clarity**
>
> And have the nerve **to say you are "trying to live deliberately"**, wow
>
> You ain't real, you're a Jarrod

Damn, Peggy. 

*Hidden Brain* recently did an episode on Tunnel Vision. In the episode, my guy Shankar explores the science behind the Paradox of Scarcity. I learned that when we are deprived of a resource we tend to try so hard to get it back that we lose sight of the big picture, which can in turn compromise the original goal of attaining said resource. I was being a Jarrod. I was so desperate for attaining mental clarity that I forgot about all its necessary background components: good nutrition, regular exercise and plain old *nothingness*. Sometimes it is necessary to do *nothing* to ensure that the value of everything else you do isn't *nothing*. 

Doing nothing is OK. I was initially scared of this idea because it directly conflicts with the philosophy of living a deliberate life. Right? Then I realized that I can be deliberate about doing nothing too. Passive listening makes active listening worth it. It gives you a better (subconscious) feel for the album that really helps when trying to analyze an album critically. It also just puts you in the mood to be able to embrace an album with the dedication that active listening requires. It makes music fun again (MMFA).

### Realization 4: Being focused can actually be *LESS* exhausting 

deep work. the cost of switching tasks. Satisfaction.

this is what i think i was really dragged down by when i mentioned the word exhausting. Switching my attention sfjosdjfoijoesidafjosjdfij

### Realization 5: Knowing less is knowing more

information overload 

we always want the tldr and dont retain anything

not having access to constant tldrs has led me engage with fewer things with deeper focus. 

why books are "better" they just focus you to commit only absorbing one thing cuz if you dont you get nothing out of it. Retention is better

### Realization 6: Sleepiness != Lethargy 

These are two very different feelings that I always confused as the same thing. What is sleepiness? What is Lethargy? Why is this important?

### Realization 7: Boredom is primarily born out of fear 

I get bored just as often as I did before. The only difference, however, is that 10 days ago as soon as that happened I was able to reach into my pocket and eliminate that boredom instantly. Now, I am forced to stare boredom in the face. I see that I am not bored because I have nothing to do but rather because I am scared to do the thing in my life that probably excites me the most. Satisfying things are hard. When you run out of easy things to do, it might seem like there is nothing left. But in reality, everything left to do is just *dauntingly satisfying*.

I feel like I probably encountered most of these ideas earlier in random blog posts or YouTube videos. They don't feel unique at all. But I only really feel like I've absorbed and understood them after this week. I guess it ties into #5 — if we stop trying to look at everything, we can start to abstract significant value from the things right in front of us. 

Reviewbrah of *Report Of The Week* once said, "Everything Burger King touches turns to garbage". Reviewbrah is right. In this case, Burger King is your mind. But the thing is that if you use your mind correctly, it can retain worlds of information and create magical things. One of those magical things, ladies and gentlemen, is the **Popeyes Chicken Sandwich** (Burger King is the parent company of Popeyes. I was compelled finish this metaphor. I am not apologizing).
